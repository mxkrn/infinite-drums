Infinite Drums is a drum sequencer made for [BitRate 2020](https://bitrate.devpost.com/), sourcing its sequences from the latent space of MusicVAE using [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce).

For the visualisation [cables](https://cables.gl/) is being used. For audio playback [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

## How to
